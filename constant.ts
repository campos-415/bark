      "Our dog Scully has been going to Embarkadero for the last several years for both daycare and boarding and he absolutely LOVES it! Scully can be an anxious dog and often won't eat unless he feels completely safe in his environment so finding the right daycare and boarding situation for him was challenging. Diego and his staff go above and beyond to make sure Scully is having fun and feeling comfortable. It is such a relief to be able to go on a trip and know that we are leaving our dog with people who will care for him and make him feel right at home. He always comes home happy, tired from playing all day, and somehow cleaner than he was when we drop him off! I cannot recommend Embarkadero enough!",

      "My dog loves coming here! She's your typical pandemic puppy, had never been left alone before, and we had to leave her alone for a week at Christmas. I was SO nervous, but Bonnie, Luis and Diego were extremely accommodating, and took such great care of our girl. They told me to call anytime I wanted an update, so every couple of days I'd call and they'd let me know how she was doing. I really like the fact that the dogs get to play out in the open together, and there is a compassionate and knowledgeable staff on site 24/7 to watch them.",

      "I feel so grateful to have found Embarkadero Social Club when I did almost a year ago! I had only rescued Brisket 6 months prior (he was 2 years old and had room to grow with socialization), and was a first time dog owner, so it was a challenging experience getting him trained to the point where he was socialized well enough for day care. The Embarkadero staff were so patient and nurturing with me in my journey of getting him into a daycare (they were the 3rd one I tried), and I've been so happy with the experience over the past year. Brisket has become noticeable more comfortable and social with other dogs, and he always looks so happy whenever I pick him up and drop him off.",

Our dog Toby is always happy to go to Embarkadero and always comes back happy, clean & without any issues. They post videos and pictures on there Instagram so we get to stay in touch with our little guy!",
